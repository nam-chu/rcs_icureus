These files contain the code for the chart and interface that the participant will be interacting with. 

I "vibe coded" these files in that I used chatGPT and prompted it with what I wanted. I do not know much of how the javascript was written. 

The key difficulty I had with coding in Qualtrics was aligning the Javascript and  HTML. I would write HTML in the "HTML" view but the radiobuttons would not appear when I previewed the survey. Without the radiobuttons, I was unable to add dynamaticity to the buttons in Javascript. This was recurring issue.
